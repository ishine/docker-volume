These files are generated by compiling OpenBLAS (version 0.2.20)
with the following setting in Makefile.rule:

ONLY_CBLAS  = 1
USE_OPENMP  = 0
NUM_THREADS = 24

NOTE:
1. "ONLY_CBLAS" can effectively reduce the generated library size.
2. "USE_OPENMP" controls whether to enable the parallel functionality
   of OpenMP.
3. "NUM_THREADS" can be adjusted according to the number of cores on
   the target machine. Basically it should be less than the actual
   number of cores.
4. The reason for using this setting is that the library can be used
   in both multi-threaded and single-threaded applications.
   When used in multi-threaded application, remember to call
   'openblas_set_number_threads(1)' in the application on runtime.
   Alternatively, we can compile separate libraries for multi-threaded
   or single-threaded applications.

They can be re-generated by running build.sh.
